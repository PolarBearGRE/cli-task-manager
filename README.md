# CLI Task Manager [26/10/2024]

This project was developed for learning purposes, inspired by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). 
Although I expanded some features beyond the original requirements, 
the core functionality remains aligned with the initial project goal.

### Commands
```sh
add -t "Title" -d "Description -p "Priority"
list Id -p "params" (If no ID is provided, the list will return all item)
update Id "Title" -d "Description" -p "Priority" -s "Status"
delete Id
```
